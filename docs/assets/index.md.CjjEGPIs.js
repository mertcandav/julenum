Performance and efficiency are prioritized over user experience in most cases. However, it is still important to provide an API that is as easy to use as possible. Where applicable, algorithm sources and mathematical references are clearly cited within the code comments. Calls to external languages or assembly are avoided to maintain portability, simplicity and conssitency. Every implementation must be made in Pure Jule. Designed to maximize raw CPU performance without depending on GPU acceleration or SIMD techniques.</p>',8)]))}const h=i(r,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,h as default};
